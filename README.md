## 1) What It does?

ResearchGram is a AI based tool that leverages Machine Learning, NLP and cloud computing 
to generate research paper recommendations from over 500,000+ research papers in our dataset (subset from the Arxiv dataset)
based on the input provided by the user (input can be provided in various image,video,audio and document formats).

## 2) Interface

## 3) Inspiration ?

Finding similar papers to a publication is one of the most crucial and challenging aspect of the research as researches need to manually 
inspect similar papers due to the inability of softwares like google scholar and Microsoft academic to accept non textual input making the 
process extremely inefficient.Adding to this, lack of access to university resources and libraries due to COVID-19 have amplified the existing 
obstacles faced during research. These challenged paved way for our project.
